# AWS KMS transaction signer for go-ethereum

At [welthee](https://welthee.com) we are using AWS KMS managed private keys to sign Ethereum transactions.

This little package eases integration with AWS KMS in your GoLang Ethereum project, by extending the functionality
offered by the official go-ethereum library.

## Import

```go
import "github.com/welthee/go-ethereum-aws-kms-tx-signer"
```

## Usage
In order to sign Ethereum transactions with an AWS KMS key you need to create a KMS key in AWS, and grant your 
application's principal access to use it.

Then, modify your Ethereum transactor code to use the `bind.TransactOpts` that this library returns. 

### Create an AWS KMS key
Create an AWS KMS Assymetric key with key usage of `SIGN_VERIFY` and spec `ECC_SECG_P256K1`. Make sure that you add an
appropriate key policy granting your code the following permissions:
`kms:GetPublicKey`, `kms:Sign`.

Example key policy:
```json
{
  "Sid": "AllowSignAndGetPublicKey",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Resource": "*",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": [
      "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/CMKUser",
      "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/CMKRole",
      "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:root"
    ]
  },
  "Action": [
    "kms:Sign",
    "kms:GetPublicKey"
  ]
}
```

### Your transactor code
The `abigen` tool generates bindings that are able to directly operate with the `*bind.TransactOpts` type.

For instance an IERC20 transactor integrated with the KMS signer would look like this:
```go
var client *ethclient.client
var kmsSvc *kms.KMS
var chainID *big.Int
var erc20Address common.Address

transactor, _ := internal.NewIERC20Transactor(erc20Address, client)

transactOpts := ethawskmssigner.NewAwsKmsTransactorWithChainID(kmsSvc, keyId, chainId)

tx, err := transactor.Transfer(transactOpts, toAddress, big.NewInt(amountInt))
```
Note how the `ethawskmssigner.NewAwsKmsTransactorWithChainID(...)` returns a ready to use `*bind.TransactOpts`.

In order to use in manually constructed transactions, you can use the Signer to sign your transaction yourself.
Example:
```go
transactOpts, _ := ethawskmssigner.NewAwsKmsTransactorWithChainID(kmsSvc, keyId, clChainId)
tx := types.NewTransaction(nonce, toAddress, value, gasLimit, gasPrice, nil)
signedTx, _ := transactOpts.Signer(transactOpts.From, tx)	
err = client.SendTransaction(context.TODO(), signedTx)
```
